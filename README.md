FixNameColors
=============

Was sick of plain white names in CraftBukkit so I hacked this together for my server :)

This plugin glues scoreboard team prefixes and suffixes onto chat lines, like vanilla. Useful for migrating from a vanilla server to a CraftBukkit or Spigot server. It's already fixed in PaperSpigot, I think, so if you install this on PaperSpigot you're going to have a bad day.

Nothing to configure, just plug and play.

First ever plugin, so be careful with it ;)

Btw it uses a deprecated method (Scoreboard.getPlayerTeam(OfflinePlayer)) but I'm not sure what else to do, so feel free to open an issue if you're, you know, actually good at plugin development.
